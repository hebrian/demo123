    <h1>Brian He</h1>
    <p>This past year I took a trip to Las Vegas as part of my friend's bachelor party.
        It was my first time on the "West Coast" in a long time and I had a great time.
        I thoroughly enjoyed eating In N Out Burger and seeing the many different casinos.

    <h2>Favorite Pet Names</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A cat named Ube</li>
        <li>A dog named Masala</li>
        <li>A rabbit named Jolly</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <p>My favorite restaurant in the Boston area is <a href="https://sunkongmalden.com/">Sun Kong</a>. I think it has the best dim sum
        at an affordable price compared to other restaurants in the area. While there may be
        a line, I think it is worth the wait.
    </p>
    <h2>Favorite Food</h2>

        My favorite food is Pho, which a Vietnamese soup dish conmposed of broth, rice noodles, vegetables, and meat.
        I think it is a great comfort food and I enjoy eating it on cold and warm days.
